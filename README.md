# History of JavaScript

About a year ago I prepared talk about Modularity In JS. Then after some time I decided to write article on this topic. It was really fun process. To do the article more legit I contacted with stellar people from JS community and TC39 on twitter. In the process of research of JS modularity I figured out other facts about history of JS, that I thought can be interesting to someone else.

Anyway the knowing of history of anything can give us a lot in the perpective and it's interesting to know what persons are stand behind the particular technology. So I've decided to write a series of independent articles about JavaScript history. And who knows maybe in the future it will become a book. Anyway for me persanally it's fun to figure out some facts and to know something new about technology that I use everyday.

There is only one article at this moment ;) but in the progress though. I hope there will be more time to dive in the topic of JS history.

Current plan is series of this articles:

1. Early Years of JavaScript (empty)
2. Short History of UI Toolkits (empty)
3. Rise of MVC (empty)
4. [Evolution of JS Modularity](https://github.com/myshov/history_of_javascript/tree/master/4_evolution_of_js_modularity) (work in progress)
5. Bundlers as They Are (empty)
6. Let's Transpile It (empty)
7. Functional JavaScript (empty)

Let's figure out the history of an emerging one of the most prevalent technologies to date.
